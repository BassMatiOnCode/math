<h1>Algebra</h1>

<h2 cbc>Level of Abstractions</h2><div>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic">Arithmetic</a> is an elementary field of mathematics that studies numerical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. More advanced arithmetic includes exponentiation, roots, and logarithms. Arightmetic systems are based on integer, rational and real numbers, sometimes even complex numbers, or numeral systems such as decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal. </p>
	
<p>Arithmetic is closely related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory">number therory</a>.</p>

<p><em>Elementary</em> or <em>college algebra</em> constitutes the first level of abstraction by allowing indefinite quantities in the form of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)">variables</a></em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation">equations</a>. Elementar algebra is not concerned with alebraic structures outside of real and complex numbers.</p>

<p>Abstract algebra is the next higher level of abstraction, which is not restricted to a specific domain, and studies classes of algebraic structures like groups and rings. These structures are not restricted to the typical algebraic operations.</p>
